## ComputerVision-Projects with Django


This project files requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:

## Module Used - ðŸ’»

```python
OpenCV
Pillow
dlib
Numpy
CSV
Haar Cascade
LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram)
Django
 

```

## Software Used 

```python
VS CODE

```


## Detection

Detection is done by the help of OpenCV and Haar cascades
Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers. Today we will be using the face classifier. You can experiment with other classifiers as well.




## Recognition

Recognition is done by LBPH recogniser
Local Binary Pattern (LBP) is a simple yet very efficient texture operator which labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number.

LBPH is one of the easiest face recognition algorithms. It can represent local features in the images. It is possible to get great results (mainly in a controlled environment). It is robust against monotonic gray scale transformations. It is provided by the OpenCV library (Open Source Computer Vision Library).

## Manage record in CSV files by Django APIs
By the help of Django, webcam can capture the face of user at registration, registered user can give their attendance by face detection and name and date will save in csv file for recod.
